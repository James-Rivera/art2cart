## üìä Test Results Summary

All tests were used during the cart functionality fix process and helped identify:

- ‚úÖ **Root cause**: INNER JOIN failures with NULL user_id values
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: LEFT JOIN with COALESCE for graceful NULL handling
- ‚úÖ **Verification**: All cart functions now work consistently
- ‚úÖ **Data quality**: Identified and provided fixes for NULL user_id issues

## üßπ Cleanup Notes

These test scripts can be safely removed from production since the main cart functionality is now working. However, they may be useful for:

- **Future debugging** if similar issues arise
- **Development reference** for understanding the cart system
- **Testing new cart features** or modifications

## üîß Technical Context

These scripts were created to resolve the issue where:
- Cart header showed "3 items" 
- Cart page showed "Your cart is empty"
- Root cause was database JOIN failures due to missing user data

The fix involved changing from INNER JOIN to LEFT JOIN in the Cart class and adding proper NULL value handling.
